# POLICY-RELEVANT QUESTIONS FOR ICARE 2025

Teams may explore the following questions. These are optional but aligned with the competition scoring.

---

## **A. Infrastructure & Flood Control Governance (Dataset 1)**

1. Are delayed DPWH flood control projects clustered in specific DEOs or regions?  
2. Do certain contractors dominate project awards in ways that may signal collusion?  
3. How accurate are project timelines relative to planned dates?  
4. Are high-cost flood control projects more prone to delays?  
5. Are project components being split (“phase-splitting”) to evade procurement thresholds?  
6. Do contractor networks suggest patterns of political favoritism?  

---

## **B. Fiscal & Electoral Governance (Dataset 2)**

1. Do LGUs increase welfare or infrastructure spending in election years?  
2. Are re-elected incumbents associated with higher or lower governance performance (e.g., social services share)?  
3. Are politically dominant LGUs (low ENC) spending less on accountability-friendly sectors (education, welfare)?  
4. Does IRA dependence reduce incentives for improving local revenue collection?  
5. Are provinces with high vote concentration (`p1`) more prone to misaligned expenditures (e.g., high admin spending, low social sectors)?  
6. Do LGUs with strong local source revenues invest more in long-term development?

## **C. Integrated Governance Questions (Dataset 1 + Dataset 2)**

1. Do provinces with low political competition experience more flood control project delays?  
2. Are LGUs with weak fiscal governance (low social spending, high admin spending) also locations where flood control anomalies are concentrated?  
3. Does political party affiliation correlate with differing infrastructure governance outcomes?  
4. Are flood control projects more likely to be delayed in election years?  
5. Do provinces with high IRA dependence display more contractor concentration or project duplication?

## **D. Policy Solution Angles**

Teams may propose:

- Stronger fiscal transparency or audit triggers  
- Algorithmic procurement monitoring  
- Anti-collusion contractor profiling  
- Evidence-based budget allocation reforms  
- Political competition strengthening mechanisms  
- Social spending benchmarks tied to fiscal capacity
